description: An analysis of my location history from Google Location History.

<p>Since around 2012, I've had a phone that keeps track of my location whenever it's on, using Google's Location History. When I first started writing this software, I wanted to see where I had visited in the UK and where I most frequently was. I decided that the best way to represent this was to use a heat-map. I then turned this into a web service so that I can more easily update the images.</p>

      <button type="button" id="location-facet-month" class="toggle-button" name="location-facet" value="month">Average month</button>
      <button type="button" id="location-facet-weekday" class="toggle-button" name="location-facet" value="weekday">Average weekday</button>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/TickleThePanda/location-history">The code</a></h2>
A quick (relatively high level) how-to on turning your data into a heatmap:
<ol>
  <li>Retrieve your data from Google</li>
  <li>Load the data from the file</li>
  <li>Strip out the most inaccurate points</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a more useable coordinate system</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a more efficient data structure, like a Quadtree - <em>perhaps the most fun part of the process</em></li>
  <li>Create a heatmap array (number of points within each (x,y) of the viewport) from a viewport (scale, center point, and dimensions of the projection) - <em>another fun part</em></li>
  <li>Create a painter for the heatmap (defines color, pixel size and writes the data to some sort of canvas)</li>
  <li>Save the image to file</li>
</ol>
