<p>In an effort to keep fit and healthy, I keep track of my fitness and weight data, and do various analyses on this data. This data comes from Fitbit (a Fitbit Flex) and manually entered weight data. The code used to generate these graphs are in <a href="https://github.com/ticklethepanda/health-vis">my <code>health-vis</code> repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
