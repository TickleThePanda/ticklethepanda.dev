    Hi, I'm <strong>Panda</strong>!
  </h3>
  <p>
    I like building things with web technologies, playing board
    games and Dungeons and Dragons, traveling the UK and the
    world, taking photos on film, and hosting (usually themed)
    dinner parties.
  <p>
    When I'm working, I lead a team of software engineers at <a
    href="https://www.stfc.ac.uk">Science and Technology Facilities
    Council (STFC)</a> (part of <a href="https://ukri.org">UK Research
    and Inovation</a>). We develop web apps for the submission of
    proposals and gathering information about outcomes of experiments
    at STFC's National Laboratories.
  <p>
    Take a look at <a href="https://cv.ticklethepanda.co.uk" z>my
    résumé</a> if you're interested in looking at my professional
    experience. Or take a look at my projects on
    <a href="https://github.com/ticklethepanda">GitHub</a>

<h3>Projects</h3>

<p>In my free time, I like to spend my time on projects. They cover
  a few different areas which range from collecting and visualising
  data to sharing my photography. Sometimes I use these projects to
  learn new skills, like design and the latest web technologies, but
  most of the time they are for fun. These are the ones that I want to
  share with you, though they might not be clean and polished.
