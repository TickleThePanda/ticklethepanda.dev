    Hi, I'm <strong>Panda</strong>!
  </h3>

  <h4>Who am I?</h4>
  <p>
    That's a big question. I'm a queer nerd. I aspire to help make the
    world a better place.  I have green eyes, freckles, and long
    hair - sometimes a beard.

  <h4>What do I like to do?</h4>
  <p>
    I have a few hobbies. I like making things (usually with web
    technologies), playing board and role playing games, travelling and
    trying out new things, and doing analogue photography. I also
    enjoy listening to music, hiking, making pizza, and brewing coffee.

  <h4>What about my work?</h4>
  <p>
    I am an experienced software developer with a broad range of skills.
    Take a look at <a href="https://cv.ticklethepanda.co.uk" z>my
    résumé</a> if you're interested in looking in more detail
    at my professional experience.

  <h4>Where can you find me?</h4> 
  <p>
    I share most of the code for my personal projects on
    <a href="https://github.com/ticklethepanda">@TickleThePanda at GitHub</a>.
    If you want to chat (I hope you feel you can do), you can find me at
    <a rel="me" href="https://tech.lgbt/@panda">@panda@tech.lgbt on Mastodon</a>.
    Or you can use this <a href="/contact-me/">form to contact me</a>.

<h4>What do you I want to share with you?</h4>

<p>These are my projects I'd like to share with you. I share most things, no matter
their state, and I've highlighted the ones I like the most.
