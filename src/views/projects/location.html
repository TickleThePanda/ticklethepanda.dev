  Since around 2012, I've had a phone that keeps track of my location whenever
  it's on, using Google's Location History. When I first started writing this
  software, I wanted to see where I had visited in the UK and where I most
  frequently was. I decided that the best way to represent this was to use a
  heat-map. I then turned this into a web service so that I can more easily
  update the images.

  Here's a quick (relatively high level) how-to on turning your data into a
  heatmap:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Retrieve your data from Google</li>
  <li>Load the data from the file</li>
  <li>Strip out the most inaccurate points</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a more useable coordinate system</li>
  <li>
    Convert the data to a more efficient data structure, like a Quadtree -
    <em>perhaps the most fun part of the process</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a heatmap array (number of points within each (x,y) of the viewport)
    from a viewport (scale, center point, and dimensions of the projection) -
    <em>another fun part</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a painter for the heatmap (defines color, pixel size and writes the
    data to some sort of canvas)
  </li>
  <li>Save the image to file</li>
</ol>
