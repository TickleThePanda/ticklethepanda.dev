  As an anniversary present to my partner, I created physical book from the
  messages that we sent to each other over various digital messenging services,
  like Facebook, Skype, and WhatsApp.

  Initially, the plan was to make a single book that contained all of our
  messages; however, we had spoken way too much for it to fit in one - it would
  have been <em>10</em> instead. After having the book printed, I found that I
  probably could have reduced this by <em>some</em> amount.

<p>
  You can find the code in its repository on GitHub,
  <a href="https://github.com/TickleThePanda/messages-book"
    ><code>message-book</code></a
  >.

  To create the book, I had to first compile all of the messages across the
  different formats into a single sorted data structure - a sorted list. The
  input formats ranged from HTML for Facebook Messenger to SQLite for Skype.
  Additional problems cropped up, like the Skype messages appeared multiple
  times (since I had multiple databases) and so I had to find a way to remove
  the duplicates - thankfully there was a unique ID for the messages hanging
  about!
</p>

  Next, I had to convert this sorted list of messages into a PDF format so that
  it could be printed. For this I used <code>itextpdf</code>. This included some
