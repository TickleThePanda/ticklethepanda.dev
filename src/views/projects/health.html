<p>
  In an effort to keep fit and healthy, I keep track and analyse my fitness
  data. I have created a simple web service to keep track of my weight. See
  <a href="https://github.com/ticklethepanda/health-vis"
    >my <code>health-vis</code> repository on GitHub</a
  >.
</p>
<h3>Collection methodology</h3>
<p>
  This web service consists of endpoints to get and store data for weight. This
  data is stored in a Postgres database. This service and database is deployed
  to Heroku.
